The program should function properly.

It was tested on a virtual machine with Debian 7.11 
and Linux 3.2 kernel. My laptop along with an external
keyboard was used. 

Changes were made in the usb_kbd struct and in
the usb_kbd_event function. 

Logic was added in the usb_kbd_event function that 
used the previous LED's urb information along with the 
current led information to determine the proper logic
and know when to switch the capslock led.

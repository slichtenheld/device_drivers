A lot of it is repetitious compared to the DDUSBKeyboardTesting ppt slides, but should hopefully clarify some things and help you get started. Also, what’s nice about using your laptop is if you screw up, your laptop keyboard still works fine :) Comment if anything didn’t work for you.

NOTE: I have set this up on a laptop running Ubuntu using VirtualBox as my VM. I’m not sure how step 3 would work on Windows and whether this may cause any issues. 

Create new Debian VM in VirtualBox
http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/
You only need to download debian-8.7.1-amd64-CD-1.iso
the rest can be installed over the internet (not sure if rest is actually needed)
When setting up your vm, make sure to create a root password, not setting one up will not allow you to run “su” later, which is needed because sudo is not totally privileged in Debian
download all of linux source, compile etc
su
apt-get install linux-source-3.2
tar xjf /usr/src/linux-source-3.2.tar.bz2
cd linux-source-3.2/
install libncurses5-dev
aptitude update
aptitude install libncurses-dev
make menuconfig
don’t need to change anything here, just exit
make clean
apt-get install dpkg-dev
make deb-pkg
dpkg -I ../linux-image-3.2.86_3.2.86-2_amd64.deb
doesn’t do anything, just displays you what you have
shutdown -r now
Make sure VB can see your USB devices
shutdown your VM and VirtualBox
On your host
sudo usermod -aG vboxusers <username>
logout/login or reboot
Make host USB keyboard accessible by VirtualBox
slide 17 of ppt
Add your print statements to usbkbd.c
linux-source-3.2/drivers/hid/usbhid/usbkbd.c
Compile USBKBD module and insert (from linux-source-3.2 directory and as su)
make SUBDIRS=drivers/hid/usbhid/ CONFIG_USB_KBD=m modules
insmod drivers/hid/usbhid/usbkbd.ko
lsmod | grep usbkbd
usbkbd should be listed 
ls -l /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbkbd/
compare to slide 15
Who’s in charge?
dmesg
should see some info about the attached keyboard
last line tells you which port your keyboard is using
follow slide 23 to write your script to switch drivers
*if on laptop, don’t have to worry about writing a script since your laptop’s keyboard will still work
Test!
ls -l /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbkbd/
should now list another device
dmesg
should see your print statements

(Optional) Install other programs you like using, terminal can be found under Applications->Accessories
git
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core
sublime text
wget http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/sublime-text_build-3083_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i sublime-text_build-3083_amd64.deb

This testcase illustrates the issue of multiple 
processes/threads attempting to open the device.
If both processes/threads open the device before
one of them has a chance to switch it to mode 2,
one of the processes/threads will deadlock. 

This is caused by the same underlying reason as 
testcase 2:

	if (devc->mode == MODE1) {
	        devc->count1++;
	        up(&devc->sem1);
	        down_interruptible(&devc->sem2);
	        return 0;
	}

where opening multiple devices in mode 1 will 
lead to a deadlock.
